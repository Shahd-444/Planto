## üß† Architecture

- **MVVM**
  - `ReminderViewModel`: manages add flow and scheduling
  - `EditPlantViewModel`: manages editing and deletion
  - `TodayReminderViewModel`: manages list, selection, and sheets (referenced; assumed present in project)

- **Data Layer**
  - `PlantStore`: `ObservableObject` holding `[Plant]` in memory
  - `Plant`: `Identifiable`, `Equatable` struct with plant details

- **Notifications**
  - `NotificationManager`: Singleton handling authorization, scheduling, cancelation, and foreground presentation
  - Uses `UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger` for development intervals

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 17 or later (SwiftUI `NavigationStack` and modern APIs)
- Swift Concurrency (`async/await`) enabled
- User Notifications capability (Local notifications)

---

## üöÄ Setup

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Ensure the ‚ÄúPush Notifications‚Äù and ‚ÄúBackground Modes‚Äù capabilities are configured if needed for your testing scenario. For local notifications, enable ‚ÄúUser Notifications.‚Äù
3. On first launch, the app should request notification permission. You can also proactively call:

```swift
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = NotificationManager.shared
await NotificationManager.shared.requestAuthorization()
